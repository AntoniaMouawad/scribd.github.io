As we build [the largest library in the world](/blog/2019/building-the-library.html), we need more manpower, and more
importantly more **womanpower**. As we make plans to scale our product and make way
to scale our users, we need a way to scale our engineering teams as well. We
are actively looking to expand our teams at all our offices and particularly in
Toronto. Between the University of Toronto and Waterloo, we discovered long ago
that there are lots of talented people around Toronto, and have since made
Toronto the home of our second engineering office! Partnering with Women Who
Code Toronto chapter seemed like a perfect way for us to launch Scribd's
footprint as an engineering brand and attract a diverse talent.  Four women
from Scribd engineering flew to Toronto from San Francisco last week to talk
about a wide range of topics. The
[event](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Toronto/events/266758297/) was
organized by our SF based recruiter Lucas and our HR partner in Toronto office,
Tammy who took care of every detail for the event to be successful. There were
about 50+ attendees to the event, mostly women. The event started off with
Katerina welcoming the
guests and giving a brief overview of what we're building at Scribd, and then
went straight into the talks!


First up  was **Paige Stone** (Software Engineer, Notifications) who presented "Green Field projects
and how I learnt to love Migrations."  She talked about the importance of
evaluating and determining whether solution involves re-iterating through
existing code or building something from scratch. She also shared some
nitty-gritty details on the re-write of our marketing integration to integrate
with [Iterable](https://iterable.com/), and the different trade-offs that we
made in the process.

Next up was **Nikki Hernandez** (Web QA engineer) who chose to talk on the
importance of quality with "Donâ€™t go chasing waterfalls: owning quality as a
whole team effort in an agile world." Not many people are aware of what a fully
agile process means and most of us are pretty satisfied with "as long as we are
not following the waterfall model" but Nikki's talk explained mini-waterfalls
and how they may sneak up even when we are (or we think we are) following the
agile process. She talked about about the many challenges that we face today to
maintain quality in an environment with many cross functional teams. Building
quality products is everyone's responsibility and she shared various tips,
tricks and practical approaches that we could all use to build quality products
and not make it just a certain team's responsibility.

**Katerina Hanson** (Engineering Manager, Payments) jumped back "on stage" to
share some thoughts on metrics and alerts with "Instrumenting your Code for
Great Justice." Katerina is a self taught software engineer. She talked about
metrics and alerts, the why's and how's of developing meaningful metrics,
visualizing the health of your systems, and using instrumentation to
effectively debug, deprecate, and optimize your code.

The last talk of the night was from me, and I chose a non-technical topic: "What you
seek is seeking you : Find the company and culture that is right for you." I
shared my journey as an engineer, as a woman in the tech field and as a
mom, the many difficult situations one might face in this fast moving industry
and how introspection to evaluate oneself is essential to make meaningful
career decisions. Having imposter syndrome is a real issue but consciously
fighting it is important too. I also discussed the importance of being valued
and accepted at a company and how culture of a company could be influenced.

Towards the end, we had some time for answering questions and most of the
questions were around women wanting to know more about _switching careers to
software_! There were some interesting questions about hiring and the process to
go about it.  One of my greatest joys in life is to witness women uplifting
other women and this event was certainly one of those occasions. We, at Scribd,
are fueled to reach out to more female engineers and tell them about Scribd and
the positive workplace it is to be - To be valued, to be accepted and to be a
woman.
