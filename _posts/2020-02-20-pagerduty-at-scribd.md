Late last year we filmed a [customer success story with
PagerDuty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yn0PZ_yMnM), which has since been
published to YouTube [and
Twitter](https://twitter.com/pagerduty/status/1227275743178170369). As we
discussed in [our previous post about pager
duty](/blog/2019/managing-pagerduty-rotations.html), we're big fans of the
service, and I was happy to sit spend a couple hours talking with their team
about what's been going well thus far. All that talking was smashed into a
brief little marketing video, embedded below:

This year we're going to see even more Scribd teams adopting PagerDuty to
manager their own incident response practices and policies. None of which would
be possible without PagerDuty!
