Most of us are new to full-time telework and the challenges that come along
with a 10-foot commute. I'm here to share some tips on ways you can help to
keep business sensitive data secure outside the office.

The EU has already warned the business community that data protection
authorities will carefully monitor how businesses handle the public's personal
data during COVID-19. It's also only a matter of time before bad actors use
this opportunity to exploit vulnerabilities at companies that are in transition
to telework. Sadly, there's no such thing as data Purell, but there are ways to
mitigate the dangers.

Here are a few data hygiene suggestions:

* Verify that your home network is encrypted and password-protected. Lock
  it down if it isn't.
* Use your VPN to conduct business. You should not expect
  third-party VPNs to provide an adequate level of security necessary to
  conduct company business or transmit personal information.
* Never conduct official business on unencrypted or open networks.
* Use only official corporate equipment. Do not use personal home
  computers and laptops.
* Do not store company intellectual property or personal information on
  portable storage media, including portable hard drives and USB drives.
* Use extra caution when using personal mobile devices, such as phones and
  iPads, in order to conduct business. If you do so, use only encrypted apps in
  use and officially supported at your company (e.g. Slack, Zendesk, Gmail,
  etc). Do not transmit intellectual property or personal data over open
  browsers or networks.
* Do not use unofficial third-party services to conduct business
  (such as free internet scanning/faxing, etc).
* Set a locking screen saver and set it whenever you leave your desk.
  Nearly all of modern Macs are capable of unlocking a locked screen saver
  with a fingerprint.
* Observe your surroundings. Make sure that you are conducting meetings in
  private spaces and that audio is not drifting out open windows.
* Use long passwords and an encrypted password management system
  ([1Password](https://1password.com) is my favorite system).
* Watch your tabs when taking screenshots, they can often reveal sensitive
  (or embarrassing!) information.


Separately, I recommend switching your web browser to
[Brave](https://brave.com), a more secure version of Chrome that blocks most
trackers and sensors by default. Brave supports nearly all Chrome extensions
and themes, so you should be able to replicate your Chrome environment without
much hassle. I've found that Brave's security tech speeds up several in-browser
business apps (Zendesk especially).

These steps, combined with heightened awareness and common sense, should help
to keep your company and your users' data protected during this crisis.

Good luck, and stay safe!
