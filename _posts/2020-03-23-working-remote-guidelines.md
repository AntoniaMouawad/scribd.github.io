Scribd has had some remote teams for almost a decade but only recently have we
needed to be 100% remote which ended up being a very new concept for many
employees. With our teams working from different locations all over the world,
we rely heavily on video conferencing and Slack to keep team members connected
and collaborating effectively.  Over time, we have identified a variety of best
practices for folks who are working ‘remotely’ - meaning not in the room with
their colleagues. 

## With the Team

* Talk about it! Don’t assume that everyone works best the same way. Have
  discussions with your team about what works well for you and
  what’s challenging. Some teams may have established more explicit
  guidelines already.
* Set expectations about how people can get your attention - Slack tags, direct
  mentions, email, etc 
* Check-in periodically about what’s working, what should change

## On Slack

* Respond promptly during working hours, even if only to let people know that you’ll get back to them.
* Use ‘Away’ and ‘Do Not Disturb’ functions to indicate when you’re unavailable, such as on PTO/vacation or outside your working hours.
* Use the [Google Calendar/Slack plugin](https://slack.com/help/articles/206329808-Google-Calendar-for-Slack) if you want Slack to automatically indicate when you’re in meetings.
* Some groups have expectations to know when people are on lunch or otherwise
  away from keyboard for a while, so check in with your team(s) and negotiate.

## On Calendar

* Set your working hours through [this
    setting](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/7638168?hl=en) in Google Calendar.
* When you are out of the home-office, block your work calendar. This helps
  people understand when you are and are not available for collaboration.

## On video

* **Have a solid connection**
    * Be mindful of your bandwidth, computer processor, etc
    * Internet connections/bandwidth in shared spaces are unreliable; be mindful about taking meetings in new/untested environments 
* **Be visible**
    * Light your face! Pay attention to if you’re backlit and look like a silhouette 
    * Video on, unless there are connection problems, or another really good reason
* **Be audible**
    * Invest in a good microphone / headphones
    * Mute if there are problematic background noises 
* **Be present**
    * Avoid multitasking
    * Speak up / contribute to discussion


## Timezones

* Meetings like All Hands are recorded and can be watched on demand; usually
  for a couple of days afterwards.
* Your coworkers will sometimes make mistakes when scheduling meetings! Always
  assume best intentions, and be vocal in requesting rescheduling when they
  fall outside your working hours.
* Prepare for asynchronous work communications, ensure you have unblocked type
  of work when the other office is off hours.
* Prepare for others to be ending their day before or after yours.  Set alerts
  to ensure you have time to communicate in advance.
