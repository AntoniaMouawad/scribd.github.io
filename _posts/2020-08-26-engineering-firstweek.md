My first week at Scribd engineering!

Hello everyone, I'm new at Scribd and here's what the first week is like on the Core Infrastructure engineering team. It's full of smart people, great culture, and cool tech and I wanted to share my experience.

The journey starts of course, with an interview phase. This round has to be one of the most pleasant interview experiences I've had. I've been through the wringer before. From start to finish I was clear on next steps and what to expect. The recruiter was awesome, she scheduled prep meetings with me to answer questions before interviews. I got to meet my manager, the team director, all but one of my teammates (he was on PTO) and folks on other teams, even teammates in Amsterdam. The process was entirely remote due to the pandemic but that didn't take away from the experience. To me it felt just as personal as an onsite would have been by making excellent use of Google meet.

Thankfully I'm not alone at first day orientation, I'm joined by a group of new hires. Since we are all in the same boat we've started our own new-hire slack channel to support each other. To get started there is a helpful and thorough checklist for us newbies to walkthrough for setting up the basics. The better part is the team specific onboarding guide that is focused on setup tasks that pertain to tools I'll use for everyday type work. The best part though, has got to be that I got a new buddy! Scribd does new-hire buddies to show you the ropes. It goes a long way to take a little bit of the new-job tension off. You can go to your new hire buddy for anything from onboarding to team specific questions. In my case my buddy is a tech lead so he has a wealth of knowledge on our stack or knows who to point you to if it isn't in their domain.

I was happy to hear that Scribd does new hire meet and greets to introduce managers and key people from other teams to start building collaborative relationships. Typically they are from teams you'd work closely with so that you can add more faces to your cache and get to know people. This is huge in getting comfortable with the team's area of responsibilities and who knows what. Everyone I've met at Scribd is crazy smart but more importantly super friendly which makes growing into the new job much smoother and easier. There are fun Slack channels for all kinds of things like coffee, cooking, pets, sports, cars, you name it making it easy to nerd out and meet new people.

As for the tech stack, some of it is completely new to me but that makes it exciting to learn new things and get different perspectives on solving problems. It also makes for many learning opportunities from the folks who are SMEs on areas of the stack. Being on the core infrastructure team I get to keep up with Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes and fresh new tech that comes. Our team builds and maintains the infrastructure foundation that is shared by the other engineering teams. For me the cool thing is being part of many engineering efforts and getting to share and learn knowledge from each team and each project.

My first day had other exciting news too! Scribd announced the acquisition of Slideshare, which, in current times it is great to see Scribd is doing well and making progress even as so much of the world faces trying challenges.
